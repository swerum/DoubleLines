# DoubleLines
Every time, there's a new line, this python program adds a second newline. 

It takes one commandline argument: the name of your text file.
Its output is a file called output.txt. 
All it does is go through your text and everytime you have a new line, it adds another newline, so there's a bit more space between paragraphs.

So if you want to run through the example text file, it would look something like:
  `/path/to/python DoubleLines.py example.txt`
